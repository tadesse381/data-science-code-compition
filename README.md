# Data science technical-test

## Repository content

* `DS_technical_test_tutorial.ipynb`
* Data: 4 datasets (description in `DS_technical_test_tutorial.ipynb`)


## Test guidelines

The purpose of this test is to build a model (or several) in order to classify housing assistance requests thanks to the given datasets. This is a multi-class classification task, the metric to optimize and the datasets description are explained in `DS_technical_test_tutorial.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### Expected outputs (Python scripts or jupyter notebooks):
- Data preparation
- Modelization (at least two approaches including one with a deep learning framework: Pytorch, tensorflow, keras...)
- Results analysis (BONUS : model explainability)
- BONUS : api production ready

### You will be evaluate on:
- Code clarity, efficiency and production ready
- The ability to justify and explain your choices
- The ability to explain the theory of the methods/algorithms used
- The final output score on the metric to optimize (good score below 0.7)
